# Worm CYOA (iOS)

An iOS version of the interactive Worm CYOA. The app is still in development. It was created by me from the ground up, so the code is purely my work. However, the contents of the CYOA are taken from several versions of PixelGMS' Worm CYOA V6. I took what I liked from each version and added my own modifications. So, most of the powers, perks, drawbacks, etc., were created by other people. You can find some of the credit in those other CYOAs.

## Note

This app was made purely because I thought it'd be fun and also as a way for me to better my SwiftUI skills. Therefore, it may be prone to bugs.
